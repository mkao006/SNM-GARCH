  \frametitle{Data Exploration}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The data were collected every half an hour for each
      household.
    \item Each consumption series consists of 19008 observation or 396
      days.
    \item Depicted below are four time series chosen to illustrate the
      variability in the household consumption usage pattern.

  \frametitle{The Cramer Representation}
  In essence, The Cramer representation states that many time series can be
  arbitrarily approximated as a weighted sum of complex exponentials.\\
  When applied to real-valued series, the result says that many
  stationary time series can be approximated by a sum of the form:
  \begin{block}{Equation}
    $$
    x_t \approx \sum_{\lambda} A_{\lambda} \cos(\lambda t + \phi_{\lambda})
    $$
  \end{block}
}

  \frametitle{Dealing with Non-stationarity}
  However, as we have seen in the exploratory section that our data is
  clearly a non-stationary one. Complex Demodulation is a technique in
  which trades frequency resolution for time resolution and allows the
  amplitude and phase to vary with respect to time. \\Thus we arrive at
  the following representation for a time series:
  %making some compromise.
  \begin{block}{Equation}
    $$
    x_t \approx \sum_{\lambda} A_{\lambda, t} \cos(\lambda t + \phi_{\lambda, t})
    $$
  \end{block}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Complex Demodulation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $y_t = x_t \times e^{-i\lambda_0 t}$
    \item $y_t' = \text{smooth}(y_t)$
    \item Then we can obtained the amplitude and phase from the $y_t'$.
  \end{itemize}

\section{An R package}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Package Description}
  To carry out the analysis, an R package was written and
  developed. The package container's two main functions:\\
  \vspace{5mm}
  \verb|mdemodulation| \qquad  for extracting the amplitude and the phase.\\
  \verb|mmodulation| \qquad for obtaining the filtered series $y_t'$.\\
  \vspace{5mm}
  Several other accessor functions are also available.

\section{Implementation and Analysis}
\frame{
  \frametitle{Implementation and Analysis}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Demodulate the time series at 1/48, 1/336 and their first two
    harmonics. They correspond to daily and weekly cycle.
    \item Demodulate at zero to obtain the moving mean.
    \item Below we show the amplitude and phase of the demodulated
      series.
   \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Advantage: Its flexible, efficient and deals with
      non-stationarity.
    \item Also enabling to observe patterns that were difficult to
      observe in the original plot.
    \item limitation: need to obtain a sensible set of frequency. Can
      be difficult when the series contain too much noises.
    \item Statistics can be produced from the decomposition for market
      segmentation through cluster analysis.
   \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Acknowledgment}
  I would like to thank Associate Professor Ross Ihaka for everything
  he has provided me in producing this dissertation, his help,
  encouragement and the time working with him would be a lifelong
  memory for me. I would also like to thank all the lecturers that has taught
  me in the past two years, particularly Mike Forster for all the
  support and knowledge I have gained.
